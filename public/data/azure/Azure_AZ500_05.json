Only Initiative assignment enforces the defined rules on a resource. Creating an Initiative definition does not meet the goal. </p><p> You should not create a custom security Policy definition.

Send the accounts Azure AD users an invitation. 2. Ensure that the accounts Azure AD users accept the invitation so that user objects are automatically created in the resources Azure AD tenant. 3. Choose an Azure AD identity provider for authentication. For users from the accounts Azure AD tenant be able to access resources in the resources Azure AD tenant, you should send an invitation first. You can do so in the Azure AD portal by navigating to the Users menu, selecting Invite user, and adding guest user information. </p><p> Next, you should ensure that the accounts Azure AD users accept the invitation. This is so that the resources Azure AD tenant can create user objects. </p><p> Finally, you should choose an Azure AD identity provider. Azure AD is a cloud-based identity management service that provides user authentication services for Azure resources, Microsoft 365 resources, and software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications. Both tenants in the scenario are Azure AD tenants, so you should use an Azure AD identity provider. Users with Azure AD accounts in an external Azure AD tenant can be invited via email. After accepting the invitation, they can sign into the resources Azure AD tenant without any further configuration. </p><p> You should not choose an MSA identity provider. MSA is an identity provider used for Microsoft's consumer products, such as Xbox LIVE, Outlook, etc. In this case, the organization's accounts reside in Azure AD, which implies that users cannot authenticate using MSA. </p><p> You should not choose an SAMUWS-Fed identity provider. If the partner organization's identity provider is neither Azure AD nor M , you can set up a custom authentication flow using the SAM/WS-Fed protocol. This could be the case if partner's accounts reside in Active Directory (AD) on-premises. </p><p> You should not choose an email one-time passcode for authentication. This authentication mechanism can be used for external identities if they cannot be authenticated using any of the available identity providers. </p>"

    "explanation": "<p> You should complement the section Actions with the permission Microsoft.Network/•/write. If Azure built-in roles do not satisfy your needs, you can create custom roles and assign them to users similar to the procedure as you do it with the built-in ones. With the custom roles you can provide only the level of permissions as required by the user to fulfil their work. To provide only the level of permissions as required by the user to fulfil their work is called the principle of least privilege. To create a virtual machine (VM), Used needs only Compute, Resourcegroups, and Network permissions. The custom role configuration can be defined in JSON configuration file in the Actions section to provide permissions and in the notActions section to remove them. In User1's custom role definition, the Microsoft.Network/*/write permission is missing, which prevents the creation of a virtual LAN (VLAN) and network interface card (NIC). The solution to add Microsoft.Networkr/write line satisfies both requirements: the principle of least privilege and least administrative effort. </p><p> You should not assign the Contributor role to User1 at the resource group level. A contributor role is an Azure built-in role, which provides the permission to create resources at the resource group level and, as such, provides a higher level of permissions than required. Although assigning the contributor role at the resource group level would solve the error, it would not satisfy the principle of least privilege. </p><p> You should not preconfigure the resource group af50Org. Preconfiguring the resource group cannot resolve the error, as in this case the Microsoft.Network•/Wite permission is still missing. </p><p> You should not assign to the user the Virtual Machine contributor role at the subscription level. This Azure built-in role allows a user to create and manage virtual machines. This role does not provide the permission to manage a network, which is the main reason for the error in this case. This role could be useful, if you needed to provide permissions to an administrator to start/stop/reboot a VM or execute some other administrative tasks on the virtual machine. In this case, the requirement is to create a virtual machine, which requires additional permissions. This solution does not satisfy the requirement. </p><p><br></p>"

The first application is a server component that provides user authentication. </p><p>Step 2: Create a client application</p><p> The second application is a client component that's used when you're prompted by the CLI for authentication. This client application uses the server application for the actual authentication of the credentials provided by the client. </p><p>Step 3: Deploy an AKS cluster.</p><p> Use the az group create command to create a resource group for the AKS cluster. </p><p>Use the az aks create command to deploy the AKS cluster.</p><p>Step 4: Create an RBAC binding.</p><p> Before you use an Azure Active Directory account with an AKS cluster, you must create role-binding or cluster role-binding. Roles define the permissions to grant, and bindings apply them to desired users. These assignments can be applied to a given namespace, or across the entire cluster. </p><p>Reference:</p><p>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/azure-ad-integration</p>"

    "explanation": "<p> You should use Azure Firewall. Azure Firewall can be used to limit access to a specific domain or URL as well as IP addresses or ports. In this scenario, you want to limit access to the domain update.myapp.com from the server JumpHost01 </p><p> You should not use Azure Application Proxy. Application Proxy can be used to allow access to internal resources on your network and provides enhanced security including multi-factor authentication (MFA) and Conditional Access. </p><p> You should not use an NSG. An NSG contains a list of rules that are processed in ascending order based on their assigned priority number. If traffic matches a rule, then particular action (Allow or Deny) will be taken. Rules are matched using 5-tuple information (source/destination IP, source/destination port, protocol) and then either allowed or denied. In this scenario, you want to limit access to the domain update.myapp.com from the server JumpHost01. An NSG cannot block traffic destined for a particular domain or URL. </p><p> You should not use an Azure Private DNS Zone. An Azure Private DNS Zone uses your own custom domain names rather than the Azure-provided names and does not block or allow traffic. </p>"

When turned on, password hash synchronization is part of the Azure AD Connect sync process and runs every two minutes. </p><p><br></p><p>Incorrect Answers:</p><p><br></p><p> A: A federated authentication system relies on an external trusted system to authenticate users. Some companies want to reuse their existing federated system investment with their Azure AD hybrid identity solution.

It's up to the organization by using the federated system to make sure it's deployed securely and can handle the authentication load. </p><p><br></p><p> C: For pass-through authentication, you need one or more (we recommend three) lightweight agents installed on existing servers.

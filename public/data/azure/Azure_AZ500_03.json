Virtual machines (VMs) that have Update Management enabled are then scanned regularly for compliance, and the scan results are exported to a Log Analytics workspace. You should search for any VMs that require a hotfix to be installed. By selecting the hotfix from the missing updates list, the Kusto Query Language (KQL) script is automatically generated and displays a list of VMs requiring the update. The results can then be exported to a CSV file. </p><p> You should not use the Get-Hotfix command. The command searches for installed hotfixes on local and remote machines and generates a list of VMs requiring the update. However, the search is resource-intensive and requires all VMs to be powered on. </p><p> You should not use WMI or the Get-Childltem command to connect remotely to each machine, search for the hotfix, and export the results to a CSV file. Both commands require all VMs to be powered on, are resource-intensive, and can be inaccurate. </p>"

An Azure AD Premium P2 license is required for access reviews. </p><p> You should not assign all users an Office 365 E5 license, then select the Azure AD blade, select Identity Governance, and configure an access review policy. The license would include additional enterprise features that cost more and are not required to implement the solution. This scenario requests to keep the costs to a minimum.
